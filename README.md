# ANN for Heart Failure Prediction
## About heart failure
Heart failure (HF) refers to the heart's inability to effectively pump blood throughout the body. While it does not imply a complete cessation of bodily functions, HF is a leading cause of death globally. This project focuses on predicting the probability of mortality resulting from heart failure using 12 risk factors. The objective is to expedite and enhance the identification of the disease, enabling timely intervention and appropriate measures to prevent disease progression.
